# GAN-Research
Graduate research project exploring image-to-image translation using CycleGAN and other generative models.

PyTorch implementation of [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) trained on a subset of the [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset to convert images between *smiling* and *not smiling*

Exploring how alterations to the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) evaluation metric improves the human-perceved quality of generated images.
