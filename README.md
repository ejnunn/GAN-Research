# GAN-Research
Graduate research project exploring image-to-image translation using CycleGAN and other generative models.

PyTorch implementation of [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) trained on a subset of the [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset to convert images between *smiling* and *not smiling*

Exploring how alterations to the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) evaluation metric improves the human-perceved quality of generated images.

## 1. About The Project

This project was undertaken to satisfy the ***CPSC5900 Graduate Research Project*** at [Seattle University](https://www.seattleu.edu/scieng/computer-science/)'s Computer Science department. Its main purpose is to explore field of Deep Learning and generative adversarial networks (GANS) for image generation, and their output quality metrics.

One of the most commonly used metrics is called the [Frechet Inception Distance (FID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_inception_distance) measures the distance between two distributions of high-dimentional feature maps obtained by extracting the final pooling layer activatations of [Inception V3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567)
